# Guide: Groups

Organize your timeline with Smart Groups.

## Using Groups

Groups allow you to gather multiple tracks. This is useful for separating different sections of a song or different types of instruments (e.g., all percussion tracks in a single group).

## Group Management

**Groups** allow you to organize your tracks, which is especially useful for complex projects with many instruments.

### Create a Group

1.  In the **Track Management Panel**, click the **Create a Group** button.
2.  A dialog will appear:
    -   Enter the **Group Name** (e.g., Drums, Melody).
3.  The new group appears in the list.

### Manage Tracks in a Group

-   **Add**: Click the **(+)** button next to the group name to move existing tracks into it.
-   **Remove**: Click the **(-)** button next to a track *inside* a group to move it out.

### Group Options

Just like individual tracks, groups have options:

-   **Edit**: Rename the group.
-   **Delete**: Delete the group (tracks inside will be moved out or deleted depending on your choice).
-   **Hide (Eye Button)**: Click the eye to the left of the group name to **Mute/Hide** all tracks it contains at once. This is great for focusing on a specific part of the music.

## Logic and Hierarchy

- **Visibility**: Toggle group visibility to declutter your workspace.
- **Grouped Actions**: Apply changes to all tracks in a group simultaneously.
- **Export**: Groups are preserved in the JSON export for logical organization in your game.
