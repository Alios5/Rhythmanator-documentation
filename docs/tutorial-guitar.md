# Tutorial: Create a Guitar-style Game

Learn how to use RhythmNator Editor to create sheets for a guitar-based rhythm game.

## Step 1: Lanes
Create 5 tracks, each representing a "string" or a button on the guitar.

## Step 2: Note Placement
Place notes that match the guitar melody. Use "Sustains" for held notes and vibrato sections.

## Step 3: Event Mapping
Assign colors to each track using event keys so your game engine knows which button to display on the screen.

## Step 4: Testing
Play the audio at 50% speed to ensure each note aligns perfectly with the guitar riffs.
