# Guide: Audio Management and BPM

Perfect synchronization between the music and your grid is the key to a good sheet. This guide explains how to manage your audio files and configure the tempo (BPM).

## 1. Music Management

In RhythmNator, you can load or change music at any time during your project.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you load a new track that is shorter than the previous one, all notes located beyond the new duration will be **automatically deleted**.

## 2. BPM Configuration

The BPM (Beats Per Minute) defines the speed of the rhythmic grid.

- **Automatic**: Click the **Lightning** icon in the audio panel for the editor to attempt to detect the BPM automatically.
- **Manual**: You can enter the value directly if you know it.
- **External Analysis**: If the detected BPM is incorrect, we recommend using third-party BPM analysis sites to get an accurate value.

## 3. Starting Offset

Offset allows you to shift the entire grid to align it perfectly with the first beat of the music. This is the crucial step so that your notes are not "off" the rhythm.

## 4. Rhythm Sync and Playback

Lower in the panel, you will find advanced synchronization options:

- **Time Signature**: Choose the rhythmic type suited for your music (e.g., 4/4).
- **Volume**: Adjust the sound level of the preview.
- **Pitch**: Speed up or slow down playback to place your notes with surgical precision.
